## Demo Video Setup

To add your demo video:

1. Place your MP4 video file in this folder
2. Name it `demo-video.mp4` (or update the filename in `LandingPage.tsx`)
3. Optionally, add a thumbnail image named `demo-thumbnail.jpg`

### Example files:
- `demo-video.mp4` - Your 1:44 demo video
- `demo-thumbnail.jpg` - Optional video thumbnail/poster image

The video will be accessible at `/demo-video.mp4` in your application.
